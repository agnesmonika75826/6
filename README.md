Continuous integration/deployment demo
===

Introduction
---

This is a simple demonstration repository to show how to use continuous integration and
continuous deployment to deploy a web service with zero downtime. To do that, I am using
some features in Docker Swarm to run multiple containers, such that during a container
upgrade, traffic is automatically routed to a different one.

I am using these things:

* PHP for scripting
* The built-in PHP web-server
* GitHub for version control (obviously `;-)`)
* Docker to containerise the app
* Alpine Linux as a lightweight container OS
* Docker Swarm to run multiple containers in a service
* HTTP Health-checks to help Docker maintain availability
* CircleCI for integration
* GitLab as a Docker image registry
* Vultr as a cloud Linux host
* Git tags as an auto-deployment trigger

If you're wanting to get this project working, but want to change individual things, go
right ahead. For example, you could use a different Git host or Docker registry
without much bother. The only thing that would need much more work to swap is CircleCI,
since the configuration file is specific to their system.

How it works
---

The heart of this project is a CircleCI configuration containing two jobs: one (`build`)
for building and testing a Docker image, and the other (`deploy`) for deploying it
automatically. When pushing code, the first job will run, and it will build the
Dockerfile. If this works, it will try to start it and run a test on it.

If the developer pushes a deploy tag (i.e. with a prefix of `deploy-`) then the first
job will additionally tag the Docker image with the Git tag and will push it to
the Docker image registry. If this is all successful, the second job will SSH to the
remote machine, pull the image from the registry, and start a rolling Swarm update.

In this example, the Swarm service is _always_ run using two replicas, so there
is always one operational container to service incoming web requests. Docker Swarm
uses a networking system called [Routing Mesh](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/ingress/#using-the-routing-mesh)
together with the custom health-checks to determine how to update internal networking
rules during a rolling update.

Target audience
---

This material is not suitable for beginners. A basic understanding of the Linux
command line, containers and general hosting concepts are pretty much essential.

Preparation
---

To follow this tutorial, sign up for the following:

* GitHub
* Vultr
* GitLab
* CircleCI

The Linux host will generally cost some money, although on most cloud systems you
are charged very accurately, and as long as you destroy the machine when you are
finished, you'll incur very low costs (less than one US dollar).

General steps
---

I will expand on these in the future, but these will be a helpful checklist for
experienced users:

* Fork this repo
* Create a small Ubuntu server in the Vultr host
* Create an empty project in GitLab (using the same name as the GitHub project)
* Connect CircleCI to GitHub and start building the project
* Customise the env vars in `config.yml` and push
* Install Docker in the remote server
* Login to the Docker registry in the remote server (`docker login ...`)
* Initialise a Docker swarm (`docker swarm init`)
* Start a Docker service in the remote ([example command](bin/swarm-start.sh))
* Add a Git tag and push that tag to kick off an automatic deployment (e.g.
`git tag -a deploy-v1 && git push --follow-tags`)

Optional:

* Obtain a domain/sub-domain and point it to the server IP
* Add other Docker machines into the Swarm (`docker swarm join`)

Running instance
---

I have a [running instance](https://cd-demo.jondh.me.uk/) of this service. This one
is a bit different because, obviously, it runs via a secure site. This is achieved
by adding a [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) front-end proxy in front of the demo
container.

Other resources
---

To achieve zero-downtime continuous deployment, I used the technique shown in
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLBGoaMz7dQ); I recommend watching it,
as it is very well presented.
